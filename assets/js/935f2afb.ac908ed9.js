A laptop is a severely resource-constrained environment whereas a cluster can have virtually unlimited resources. Worse, simple local scripts may need to be translated to a new paradigm that is understood by a cluster.","sidebar":"r"},"v/r/metaflow-on-aws/metaflow-sandbox":{"id":"v/r/metaflow-on-aws/metaflow-sandbox","title":"Metaflow Sandbox","description":"As described in Metaflow on AWS, Metaflow comes with built-in integrations to various services on AWS.
