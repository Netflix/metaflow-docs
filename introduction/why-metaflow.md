# Why Metaflow

![Here is a data scientist.](../.gitbook/assets/metaflow_docs-1.png)

![Data scientists solve important business problems. ](../.gitbook/assets/metaflow_docs-2.png)

![A good way to start solving a problem is to prototype a solution in a notebook.](../.gitbook/assets/metaflow_docs-3.png)

![There are great libraries available for machine learning that make prototyping fun.](../.gitbook/assets/metaflow_docs-4.png)

![After the first experiments, it is a good idea to start keeping track of models and data.](../.gitbook/assets/metaflow_docs-5.png)

![It can take a lot of work to get the latest data and keep the models up to date reliably.](../.gitbook/assets/metaflow_docs-6.png)

![Production workflows should run on servers, not on a laptop.](../.gitbook/assets/metaflow_docs-7.png)

![These days, servers execute containers. Workflows need to be packaged for execution. ](../.gitbook/assets/metaflow_docs-8.png)

![Where should the results go? Sometimes they are deployed as containers too.](../.gitbook/assets/metaflow_docs-9.png)

![Containerized models can be consumed by business applications.](../.gitbook/assets/metaflow_docs-10.png)

![Stakeholders evaluate the results. They want more models and better models!](../.gitbook/assets/metaflow_docs-11.png)

![Taking care of all this can be hard. Metaflow can help. ](../.gitbook/assets/metaflow_logo.png)
