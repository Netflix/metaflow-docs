# Release Notes

We take backwards compatibility very seriously. In the vast majority of cases, you can
upgrade Metaflow without expecting changes in your existing code. In the rare cases when
breaking changes are absolutely necessary, usually, due to bug fixes, you can take a
look at them in the [release notes on Github](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/releases)
before you upgrade.
