# Release Notes

Read below how Metaflow has improved over time.

We take backwards compatibility very seriously. In the vast majority of cases, you can upgrade Metaflow without expecting changes in your existing code. In the rare cases when breaking changes are absolutely necessary, usually, due to bug fixes, you can take a look at minor breaking changes below before you upgrade.

  - current.pathspec to return None when used outside Flow in [#1033](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/1033)
  - Fixed bug in the `card list` command in [#1044](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/1044)
  - Fixed issues with S3 get and ranges in [#1034](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/1034)
  - Fix `_new_task` calling bug in LocalMetadataProvider in [#1046](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/1046)

## [2.6.0 (Apr 25, 2022)](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/releases/tag/2.6.0)

The Metaflow 2.6.0 release is a minor release and introduces Metaflow's integration with [Kubernetes](https://docs.metaflow.org/scaling/introduction/effortless-scaling-with-kubernetes) and [Argo Workflows](https://docs.metaflow.org/production/scheduling-metaflow-flows/introduction/scheduling-with-argo-workflows)
- [Features](#2.6.0_features)
  - Add capability to launch Metaflow tasks on Kubernetes and schedule Metaflow flows with Argo Workflows.
  - Expose `tags` in `current` object.

#### Add capability to launch Metaflow tasks on Kubernetes and schedule Metaflow flows with Argo Workflows.
This release enables brand new capabilities for [Metaflow on top of Kubernetes](https://outerbounds.com/blog/human-centric-data-science-on-kubernetes-with-metaflow/). You can now [`run --with kubernetes`](https://docs.metaflow.org/scaling/introduction/effortless-scaling-with-kubernetes) all or parts of any Metaflow flow on top of _any_ Kubernetes cluster from your workstation. To execute your flow asynchronously, you can deploy the flow to Argo Workflows (a Kubernetes-native workflow scheduler) with a single command - [`argo-workflows create`](https://docs.metaflow.org/production/scheduling-metaflow-flows/introduction/scheduling-with-argo-workflows).

To get started, take a look at the [deployment guide for Kubernetes](https://outerbounds.com/docs/engineering-welcome/). Your feedback and feature requests are highly appreciated! - please reach out to us at slack.outerbounds.co

PR #992 addressed issue #50.

#### Expose `tags` in `current` object.
Metaflow tags are now available as part of the `current` singleton object.

```
@step
def my_step(self):
    from metaflow import current
    tags = current.tags
    ...
```

PR #1019 fixed issue #1007.

  - Add 'last modified' to S3 object ([#778](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/778))

### Improvements <a href="#user-content-v2.4.4_improvements" id="user-content-v2.4.4_improvements"></a>

#### Add default image config option as described in [#489](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/issues/489) ([#813](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/813))

We're moving to a more consistent scheme for naming options related to docker images. You can read the details in [#489](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/issues/489), but this release introduces new config options `DEFAULT_CONTAINER_IMAGE` and `DEFAULT_CONTAINER_REGISTRY` that can be used to specify docker image in addition to plugin-specific options like `KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_IMAGE`

#### Read default k8s namespace from config ([#823](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/823))

This adds a new configuration option to set the default namespace for the Kubernetes plugin

## [2.4.3 (Nov 3rd 2021)](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/releases/tag/2.4.3)

The Metaflow 2.4.3 release is a patch release

- [Bug Fixes](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/releases#v2.4.2_bugs)
  - Fix a race condition when accessing artifacts of a running task
  - Fix an issue when using a combination of `@catch` and `@retry` decorators
  - Upgrade Pandas in tutorials
- Miscellaneous
  - The code base has now been formatted with Black. PRs will automatically be formatted when submitted. If submitting PRs, you can also format your PRs using black (default options) to avoid a reformatting PR.

### Bug Fixes <a href="#user-content-v2.4.3_bugs" id="user-content-v2.4.3_bugs"></a>

#### Fix a race condition when accessing artifacts of a running task ([#789](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/789)) <a href="#user-content-789" id="user-content-789"></a>

When accessing artifacts of a running task using `Task(...).artifacts`, a race condition existed and the call could return a difficult to understand error message. This release fixes this issue and making this call will either return the artifacts present or no artifacts at all if none are present yet.

#### Fix an issue when using a combination of `@catch` and `@retry` decorators ([#776](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/776)) <a href="#user-content-776" id="user-content-776"></a>

A step as below:

```python
@retry(times=2)
@catch(var='exception')
@step
def my_step(self):
    raise ValueError()
```

would not retry 2 times as expected but instead the exception would be caught the first time around. This release fixes this issue and the step will now execute a total of 3 times and the exception will be caught on the third time.

#### Upgrade Pandas in tutorials ([#707](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/707)) <a href="#user-content-707" id="user-content-707"></a>

On macOS Big Sur, certain tutorials were broken due to using an older version of Pandas. This updates the tutorials to use 1.3.3 to solve this issue

## [2.4.2 (Oct 25th, 2021)](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/releases/2.4.2)

The Metaflow 2.4.2 release is a patch release

- [Bug Fixes](release-notes.md#bug-fixes)
  - Fix a bug with accessing legacy logs through `metaflow.client`
  - Fix a bug with task datastore access when no task attempt has been recorded

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix a bug with accessing legacy logs through `metaflow.client` ([#779](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/779))

Metaflow `v2.4.1` introduced a bug (due to a typo) in accessing legacy task logs through `metaflow.client`

```
Task("pathspec/to/task").stdout
```

This release fixes this issue.

#### Fix a bug with task datastore access when no task attempt has been recorded ([#780](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/780))

A subtle bug was introduced in Metaflow `2.4.0` where the task datastore access fails when no task attempt was recorded. This release fixes this issue.

## [2.4.1 (Oct 18th, 2021)](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/releases/2.4.1)

The Metaflow 2.4.1 release is a patch release

- [Bug Fixes](release-notes.md#bug-fixes-1)
  - Expose non-pythonic dependencies inside the conda environment on AWS Batch
- [New Features](release-notes.md#new-features)
  - Introduce size properties for artifacts and logs in metaflow.client
  - Expose attempt level task properties
  - Introduce @kubernetes decorator for launching Metaflow tasks on Kubernetes

### Bug Fixes

#### Expose non-pythonic dependencies inside the conda environment on AWS Batch ([#735](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/735))

Prior to this release, non-pythonic dependencies in a conda environment were not automatically visible to a Metaflow task executing on AWS Batch (see [#734](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/issues/734)) (they were available for tasks that were executed locally). For example

```python
import os
from metaflow import FlowSpec, step, conda, conda_base, batch

class TestFlow(FlowSpec):

    @step
    def start(self):
        self.next(self.use_node)

    @batch
    @conda(libraries={"nodejs": ">=16.0.0"})
    @step
    def use_node(self):
        print(os.system("node --version"))
        self.next(self.end)

    @step
    def end(self):
        pass


if __name__ == "__main__":
    TestFlow()
```

would print an error. This release fixes the issue with the incorrect `PATH` configuration.

### New Features

#### Introduce size properties for artifacts and logs in metaflow.client ([#752](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/752))

This release exposes size properties for artifacts and logs (stderr and stdout) in metaflow.client. These properties are relied upon by the Metaflow UI ([open-sourcing soon!](https://www.eventbrite.fi/e/netflix-data-science-metaflow-gui-pre-release-meetup-tickets-185523605097)).

#### Expose attempt level task properties ([#725](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/725))

In addition to the above mentioned properties, now users of Metaflow can access attempt specific Task metadata using the client

```
Task('42/start/452', attempt=1)
```

#### Introduce @kubernetes decorator for launching Metaflow tasks on Kubernetes ([#644](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/644))

This release marks the alpha launch of `@kubernetes` decorator that allows farming off Metaflow tasks onto Kubernetes. The functionality works in exactly the same manner as [`@batch`](/scaling/remote-tasks/introduction) -

```python
from metaflow import FlowSpec, step, resources

class BigSum(FlowSpec):

    @resources(memory=60000, cpu=1)
    @step
    def start(self):
        import numpy
        import time
        big_matrix = numpy.random.ranf((80000, 80000))
        t = time.time()
        self.sum = numpy.sum(big_matrix)
        self.took = time.time() - t
        self.next(self.end)

    @step
    def end(self):
        print("The sum is %f." % self.sum)
        print("Computing it took %dms." % (self.took * 1000))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    BigSum()
```

```
python big_sum.py run --with kubernetes
```

will run all steps of this workflow on your existing EKS cluster (which can be configured with `metaflow configure eks`) and provides all the goodness of Metaflow!

To get started follow [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L_4Fws1KoGg_dtSTaRlAcREX1F8FPS4ZaYk7eJyu_jA/edit)! We would appreciate your early feedback at [http://slack.outerbounds.co](htps://slack.outerbounds.co).

## [2.4.0 (Oct 4th, 2021)](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/releases/tag/2.4.0)

The Metaflow 2.4.0 release is a minor release and includes a _breaking change_

- [Breaking Changes](release-notes.md#breaking-changes)
  - Change return type of created_at/finished_at in the client
- [Bug Fixes](release-notes.md#bug-fixes)
  - Better error messages in case of a Conda issue
  - Fix error message in Metadata service
- [New Features](release-notes.md#new-features)
  - S3 retry counts are now configurable
  - New datastore implementation resulting in improved performance
  - S3 datatools performance improvements

### Breaking Changes

#### Change return type of created_at/finished_at in the client ([#692](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/692))

Prior to this release, the return type for `created_at` and `finished_at` properties in the Client API was a timestamp string. This release changes this to a `datetime` object, as the old behavior is considered an unintentional mis-feature (see below for details).

_How to retain the old behavior_

To keep the old behavior, append an explicit string conversion, `.strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')`, to the `created_at` and `finished_at` calls, e.g.

```
run.created_at.strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')
```

_Background_

The first versions of Metaflow (internal to Netflix) returned a `datetime` object in all calls dealing with timestamps in the Client API to make it easier to perform operations between timestamps. Unintentionally, the return type was changed to string in the initial open-source release. This release introduces a number of internal changes, removing all remaining discrepancies between the legacy version of Metaflow that was used inside Netflix and the open-source version.

The timestamp change is the only change affecting the user-facing API. While Metaflow continues to make a strong promise of backwards compatibility of user-facing features and APIs, the benefits of one-time unification outweigh the cost of this relatively minor breaking change.

### Bug Fixes

#### Better error messages in case of a Conda issue ([#706](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/706))

Conda errors printed to `stderr` were not surfaced to the user; this release addresses this issue.

#### Fix error message in Metadata service ([#712](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/712))

The code responsible for printing error messages from the metadata service had a problem that could cause it to be unable to print the correct error message and would instead raise another error that obfuscated the initial error. This release addresses this issue and errors from the metadata service are now properly printed.

### New Features

#### S3 retry counts are now configurable ([#700](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/700))

This release allows you to set the number of times S3 access are retried (the default is 7). The relevant environment variable is: `METAFLOW_S3_RETRY_COUNT`.

#### New datastore implementation resulting in improved performance ([#580](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/580))

The datastore implementation was reworked to make it easier to extend in the future. It also now uploads artifacts in parallel to S3 (as opposed to sequentially) which can lead to better performance. The changes also contribute to a notable improvement in the speed of `resume` which can now start resuming a flow twice as fast as before. Documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/blob/master/docs/datastore.md).

#### S3 datatools performance improvements ([#697](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/697))

The S3 datatools better handles small versus large files by using the `download_file` command for larger files and using `get_object` for smaller files to minimize the number of calls made to S3.

## 2.3.6 (Sep 8th, 2021)

The Metaflow 2.3.6 release is a patch release.

- [Bug Fixes](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/releases#2.3.6_bugs)
  - [Fix recursion error when `METAFLOW_DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT` is set to `conda`](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/releases#673)
  - [Allow dots in `host_volumes` attribute for `@batch` decorator](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/releases#676)

### Bug Fixes

#### [Fix recursion error when `METAFLOW_DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT` is set to `conda`](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/releases#673)

Prior to this release, setting default execution environment to `conda` through `METAFLOW_DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT` would result in a recursion error.

```
METAFLOW_DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT=conda python flow.py run
```

```
  File "/Users/savin/Code/metaflow/metaflow/cli.py", line 868, in start
    if e.TYPE == environment][0](ctx.obj.flow)
  File "/Users/savin/Code/metaflow/metaflow/plugins/conda/conda_environment.py", line 27, in __init__
    if e.TYPE == DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT][0](self.flow)
  File "/Users/savin/Code/metaflow/metaflow/plugins/conda/conda_environment.py", line 27, in __init__
    if e.TYPE == DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT][0](self.flow)
  File "/Users/savin/Code/metaflow/metaflow/plugins/conda/conda_environment.py", line 27, in __init__
    if e.TYPE == DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT][0](self.flow)
  [Previous line repeated 488 more times]
  File "/Users/savin/Code/metaflow/metaflow/plugins/conda/conda_environment.py", line 24, in __init__
    from ...plugins import ENVIRONMENTS
RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded
```

This release fixes this bug.

#### [Allow dots in `host_volumes` attribute for `@batch` decorator](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/releases#676)

Dots in volume names - `@batch(host_volumes='/path/with/.dot')` weren't being sanitized properly resulting in errors when a Metaflow task launched on AWS Batch. This release fixes this bug.

## 2.3.5 (Aug 23rd, 2021)

The Metaflow 2.3.5 release is a patch release.

- [Features](release-notes.md#features)
  - [Enable mounting host volumes in AWS Batch](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/issues/441)
- [Bug Fixes](release-notes.md#bug-fixes)
  - [Fix input values for Parameters of type `list` within a Metaflow Foreach task](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/issues/651)

### Features

#### [Enable mounting host volumes in AWS Batch](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/issues/441)

With this release, you can now [mount and access instance host volumes](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/batch-mount-efs/) within a Metaflow task running on AWS Batch. To access a host volume, you can add `host-volumes` argument to your `@batch` decorator -

```
@batch(host_volumes=['/home', '/var/log'])
```

### Bug Fixes

#### [Fix input values for Parameters of type `list` within a Metaflow Foreach task](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/issues/651)

The following flow had a bug where the value for `self.input` was being imputed to `None` rather than the dictionary element. This release fixes this issue -

```python
from metaflow import FlowSpec, Parameter, step, JSONType

class ForeachFlow(FlowSpec):
    numbers_param = Parameter(
        "numbers_param",
        type=JSONType,
        default='[1,2,3]'
    )

    @step
    def start(self):
        # This works, and passes each number to the run_number step:
        #
        # self.numbers = self.numbers_param
        # self.next(self.run_number, foreach='numbers')

        # But this doesn't:
        self.next(self.run_number, foreach='numbers_param')

    @step
    def run_number(self):
        print(f"number is {self.input}")
        self.next(self.join)

    @step
    def join(self, inputs):
        self.next(self.end)

    @step
    def end(self):
        pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    ForeachFlow()
```

## 2.3.4 (Aug 11th, 2021)

The Metaflow 2.3.4 release is a patch release.

- [Bug Fixes](release-notes.md#bug-fixes-1)
  - [Fix execution of `step-functions create` when using an `IncludeFile` parameter](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/releases#637)

### Bug Fixes

#### [Fix execution of `step-functions create` when using an `IncludeFile` parameter](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/releases#637)

PR [#607](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/607) in `Metaflow 2.3.3` introduced a bug with `step-functions create` command for `IncludeFile` parameters. This release rolls back that PR. A subsequent release will reintroduce a modified version of PR [#607](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/607).

## 2.3.3 (Jul 29th, 2021)

The Metaflow 2.3.3 release is a patch release.

  - [Fix return value of `IncludeFile` artifacts](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/releases#607)

### Features

#### [Support resource tags for Metaflow's integration with AWS Batch](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/releases#632)

Metaflow now supports setting [resource tags for AWS Batch jobs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/using-tags.html) and propagating them to the underlying ECS tasks. The following tags are attached to the AWS Batch jobs now -

- `metaflow.flow_name`
- `metaflow.run_id`
- `metaflow.step_name`
- `metaflow.user` / `metaflow.owner`
- `metaflow.version`
- `metaflow.production_token`

To enable this feature, set the environment variable (or alternatively in the `metaflow config`) `METAFLOW_BATCH_EMIT_TAGS` to `True`. Keep in mind that the IAM role (`MetaflowUserRole`, `StepFunctionsRole`) submitting the jobs to AWS Batch will need to have the `Batch:TagResource` permission.

### Bug Fixes

#### [Properly handle `None` as defaults for parameters for AWS Step Functions execution](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/releases#630)

Prior to this release, a parameter specification like -

```
Parameter(name="test_param", type=int, default=None)
```

will result in an error even though the default has been specified

```
Flow failed:
    The value of parameter test_param is ambiguous. It does not have a default and it is not required.
```

This release fixes this behavior by allowing the flow to execute as it would locally.

#### [Fix return value of `IncludeFile` artifacts](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/releases#607)

The `IncludeFile` parameter would return JSONified metadata about the file rather than the file contents when accessed through the `Metaflow Client`. This release fixes that behavior by returning instead the file contents, just like any other Metaflow data artifact.

## 2.3.2 (Jun 29th, 2021)

The Metaflow 2.3.2 release is a minor release.

- Features
  - `step-functions trigger` command now supports `--run-id-file` option

### Features

**`step-functions trigger` command now supports `--run-id-file` option**

Similar to `run` , you can now pass `--run-id-file` option to `step-function trigger`. Metaflow then will write the triggered run id to the specified file. This is useful if you have additional scripts that require the run id to examine the run or wait until it finishes.

## 2.3.1 (Jun 23rd, 2021)

The Metaflow 2.3.1 release is a minor release.

- Features
  - [Performance optimizations for `merge_artifacts`](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/releases/tag/2.3.1#556)

### Features

[**Performance optimizations for `merge_artifacts`**](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/releases/tag/2.3.1#556)

Prior to this release, `FlowSpec.merge_artifacts` was loading all of the merged artifacts into memory after doing all of the consistency checks with hashes. This release now avoids the memory and compute costs of decompressing, de-pickling, re-pickling, and recompressing each merged artifact - resulting in improved performance of `merge_artifacts`.

## 2.3.0 (May 27th, 2021)

The Metaflow 2.3.0 release is a minor release.

- Features
  - [Coordinate larger Metaflow projects with `@project`](../production/coordinating-larger-metaflow-projects)
  - [Hyphenated-parameters support in AWS Step Functions](release-notes.md#hyphenated-parameters-support-in-aws-step-functions)
  - [State Machine execution history logging for AWS Step Functions in AWS CloudWatch Logs](release-notes.md#state-machine-execution-history-logging-for-aws-step-functions)

### Features

#### [Coordinate larger Metaflow projects with `@project`](../production/coordinating-larger-metaflow-projects)

It's not uncommon for multiple people to work on the same workflow simultaneously. Metaflow makes it possible by keeping executions [isolated through independently stored artifacts and namespaces](../scaling/tagging). However, by default, [all AWS Step Functions deployments](../production/scheduling-metaflow-flows/introduction) are bound to the name of the workflow. If multiple people call `step-functions create` independently, each deployment will overwrite the previous one. In the early stages of a project, this simple model is convenient but as the project grows, it is desirable that multiple people can test their own AWS Step Functions deployments without interference. Or, as a single developer, you may want to experiment with multiple independent AWS Step Functions deployments of their workflow. This release introduces a `@project` decorator to address this need. The `@project` decorator is used at the `FlowSpec`-level to bind a Flow to a specific project. All flows with the same project name belong to the same project.

```python
from metaflow import FlowSpec, step, project, current

@project(name='example_project')
class ProjectFlow(FlowSpec):

    @step
    def start(self):
        print('project name:', current.project_name)
        print('project branch:', current.branch_name)
        print('is this a production run?', current.is_production)
        self.next(self.end)

    @step
    def end(self):
        pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    ProjectFlow()
```

```
python flow.py run
```

The flow works exactly as before when executed outside AWS Step Functions and introduces `project_name`, `branch_name` & `is_production` in the [`current`](../scaling/tagging#accessing-current-ids-in-a-flow) object.

On AWS Step Functions, however, `step-functions create` will create a new workflow `example_project.user.username.ProjectFlow` (where `username` is your username) with a user-specific [isolated namespace](../scaling/tagging) and a [separate production token](../scaling/tagging#production-tokens).

For deploying experimental (test) versions that can run in parallel with production, you can deploy custom branches with `--branch`

```
python flow.py --branch foo step-functions create
```

To deploy a production version, you can deploy with `--production` flag (or pair it up with `--branch` if you want to run multiple variants in production)

```
python project_flow.py --production step-functions create
```

Note that the isolated namespaces offered by `@project` work best when your code is designed to respect these boundaries. For instance, when writing results to a table, you can use current.branch_name to choose the table to write to or you can disable writes outside production by checking current.is_production.

#### Hyphenated-parameters support in AWS Step Functions

Prior to this release, hyphenated parameters in AWS Step Functions weren't supported through CLI.

```python
from metaflow import FlowSpec, Parameter, step

class ParameterFlow(FlowSpec):
    foo_bar = Parameter('foo-bar',
                      help='Learning rate',
                      default=0.01)

    @step
    def start(self):
        print('foo_bar is %f' % self.foo_bar)
        self.next(self.end)

    @step
    def end(self):
        print('foo_bar is still %f' % self.foo_bar)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    ParameterFlow()
```

Now, users can create their flows as usual on AWS Step Functions (with `step-functions create`) and trigger the deployed flows through CLI with hyphenated parameters -

```
python flow.py step-functions trigger --foo-bar 42
```

#### State Machine execution history logging for AWS Step Functions

Metaflow now logs [State Machine execution history in AWS CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/cw-logs.html) for deployed Metaflow flows. You can enable it by specifying `--log-execution-history` flag while creating the state machine

```
python flow.py step-functions create --log-execution-history
```

Note that you would need to set the environment variable (or alternatively in your Metaflow config) `METAFLOW_SFN_EXECUTION_LOG_GROUP_ARN` to your AWS CloudWatch Logs Log Group ARN to pipe the execution history logs to AWS CloudWatch Logs

## 2.2.13 (May 19th, 2021)

The Metaflow 2.2.13 release is a minor patch release.

- Bug Fixes
  - [Handle regression with `@batch` execution on certain docker images](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/releases/tag/2.2.13#534)

### Bug Fixes

#### [Handle regression with `@batch` execution on certain docker images](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/releases/tag/2.2.13#534)

Certain [docker images](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/pre-built-containers-frameworks-deep-learning.html) override the entrypoint by executing `eval` on the user-supplied command. The `2.2.10` release impacted these docker images where we modified the entrypoint to support datastore based logging. This release fixes that regression.

## 2.2.12 (May 18th, 2021)

The Metaflow 2.2.12 release is a minor patch release.

- Features
  - [Add capability to override AWS Step Functions state machine name while deploying flows to AWS Step Functions](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/releases/tag/2.2.12#532)
  - [Introduce heartbeats for Metaflow flows](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/releases/tag/2.2.12#333)
- Bug Fixes
  - [Handle regression with `Click >=8.0.x`](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/releases/tag/2.2.12#526)

### Features

#### [Add capability to override AWS Step Functions state machine name while deploying flows to AWS Step Functions](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/releases/tag/2.2.12#532)

Prior to this release, the State Machines created by Metaflow while deploying flows to AWS Step Functions had the same name as that of the flow. With this release, Metaflow users can now override the name of the State Machine created by passing in a `--name` argument : `python flow.py step-functions --name foo create` or `python flow.py step-functions --name foo trigger`.

#### [Introduce heartbeats for Metaflow flows](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/releases/tag/2.2.12#333)

Metaflow now registers heartbeats at the run level and the task level for all flow executions (with the exception of flows running on AWS Step Functions where only task-level heartbeats are captured). This provides the necessary metadata to ascertain if a run/task has been lost. Subsequent releases of Metaflow will expose this information through the client.

### Bug Fixes

#### [Handle regression with `Click >=8.0.x`](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/releases/tag/2.2.12#526)

The latest release of Click (8.0.0) broke certain idempotency assumptions in Metaflow which PR [#526](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/526) addresses.

## 2.2.11 (Apr 30th, 2021)

The Metaflow 2.2.11 release is a minor patch release.

- Bug Fixes
  - Fix regression that broke compatibility with Python 2.7

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix regression that broke compatibility with Python 2.7

`shlex.quote`, introduced in #493, is not compatible with Python 2.7. `pipes.quote` is now used for Python 2.7.

## 2.2.10 (Apr 22nd, 2021)

The Metaflow 2.2.10 release is a minor patch release.

- Features
  - AWS Logs Group, Region and Stream are now available in metadata for tasks executed on AWS Batch
  - Execution logs are now available for all tasks in Metaflow universe
- Bug Fixes
  - Fix regression with `ping/` endpoint for Metadata service
  - [Fix the behaviour of `--namespace=` CLI args when executing a flow](https://gitter.im/metaflow_org/community?at=605decca68921b62f48a4190)

### Features

#### AWS Logs Group, Region and Stream are now available in metadata for tasks executed on AWS Batch

For tasks that execute on AWS Batch, Metaflow now records the location where the AWS Batch instance writes the container logs in AWS Logs. This can be handy in locating the logs through the client API -

```
Step('Flow/42/a').task.metadata_dict['aws-batch-awslogs-group']
Step('Flow/42/a').task.metadata_dict['aws-batch-awslogs-region']
Step('Flow/42/a').task.metadata_dict['aws-batch-awslogs-stream']
```

#### Execution logs are now available for all tasks in Metaflow universe

All Metaflow runtime/task logs are now published via a sidecar process to the datastore. The user-visible logs on the console are streamed directly from the datastore. For Metaflow's integrations with the cloud (AWS at the moment), the compute tasks logs (AWS Batch) are directly written by Metaflow into the datastore (Amazon S3) independent of where the flow is launched from (User's laptop or AWS Step Functions). This has multiple benefits

- Metaflow no longer relies on AWS Cloud Watch for fetching the AWS Batch execution logs to the console - AWS Cloud Watch has rather low global API limits which have caused multiple issues in the past for our users
- Logs for AWS Step Functions executions are now also available in Amazon S3 and can be easily fetched by simply doing `python flow.py logs 42/start` or `Step('Flow/42/start').task.stdout`.

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix regression with `ping/` endpoint for Metadata service

Fix a regression introduced in `v2.2.9` where the endpoint responsible for ascertaining the version of the deployed Metadata service was erroneously moved to `ping/` from `ping`

#### [Fix the behaviour of `--namespace=` CLI args when executing a flow](https://gitter.im/metaflow_org/community?at=605decca68921b62f48a4190)

`python flow.py run --namespace=` now correctly makes the global namespace visible within the flow execution.

## 2.2.9 (Apr 19th, 2021)

The Metaflow 2.2.9 release is a minor patch release.

- Bug Fixes
  - [Remove pinned pylint dependency](https://gitter.im/metaflow_org/community?at=60622af8940f1d555e277c12)
  - [Improve handling of `/` in image parameter for batch](https://gitter.im/metaflow_org/community?at=5f80e21d02e81701b0106c6d)
  - List custom FlowSpec parameters in the intended order

### Bugs

#### [Remove pinned pylint dependency](https://gitter.im/metaflow_org/community?at=60622af8940f1d555e277c12)

Pylint dependency was unpinned and made floating. See PR [#462](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/462).

#### [Improve handling of `/` in image parameter for batch](https://gitter.im/metaflow_org/community?at=5f80e21d02e81701b0106c6d)

You are now able to specify docker images of the form `foo/bar/baz:tag` in the batch decorator. See PR [#466](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/466).

#### List custom FlowSpec parameters in the intended order

The order in which parameters are specified by the user in the FlowSpec is now preserved when displaying them with `--help`. See PR [#456](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/456).

## 2.2.8 (Mar 15th, 2021)

The Metaflow 2.2.8 release is a minor patch release.

- Bug Fixes
  - [Fix `@environment` behavior for conflicting attribute values](https://gitter.im/metaflow_org/community?at=604a2bfb44f5a454a46cc7f8)
  - [Fix `environment is not callable` error when using `@environment`](https://gitter.im/metaflow_org/community?at=6048a07d823b6654d296d62d)

### Bugs

#### [Fix `@environment` behavior for conflicting attribute values](https://gitter.im/metaflow_org/community?at=604a2bfb44f5a454a46cc7f8)

Metaflow was incorrectly handling environment variables passed through the `@environment` decorator in some specific instances. When `@environment` decorator is specified over multiple steps, the actual environment that's available to any step is the union of attributes of all the `@environment` decorators; which is incorrect behavior. For example, in the following workflow -

```python
from metaflow import FlowSpec, step, batch, environment
import os
class LinearFlow(FlowSpec):
    @environment(vars={'var':os.getenv('var_1')})
    @step
    def start(self):
        print(os.getenv('var'))
        self.next(self.a)
    @environment(vars={'var':os.getenv('var_2')})
    @step
    def a(self):
        print(os.getenv('var'))
        self.next(self.end)
    @step
    def end(self):
        pass
if __name__ == '__main__':
    LinearFlow()
```

```
var_1=foo var_2=bar python flow.py run
```

will result in

```

Note the output for the step `a` which should have been `bar`. PR [#452](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/452) fixes the issue.

#### [Fix `environment is not callable` error when using `@environment`](https://gitter.im/metaflow_org/community?at=6048a07d823b6654d296d62d)

Using `@environment` would often result in an error from `pylint` - `E1102: environment is not callable (not-callable)`. Users were getting around this issue by launching their flows with `--no-pylint`. PR [#451](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/451) fixes this issue.

## 2.2.7 (Feb 8th, 2021)

The Metaflow 2.2.7 release is a minor patch release.

- [Bug Fixes](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/releases#2.2.7_bugs)
  - [Handle for-eaches properly for AWS Step Functions workflows running on AWS Fargate](https://gitter.im/metaflow_org/community?at=601f56d955359c58bf28ef1a)

### Bugs

#### [Handle for-eaches properly for AWS Step Functions workflows running on AWS Fargate](https://gitter.im/metaflow_org/community?at=601f56d955359c58bf28ef1a)

Workflows orchestrated by AWS Step Functions were failing to properly execute `for-each` steps on AWS Fargate. The culprit was lack of access to instance metadata for ECS. Metaflow instantiates a connection to Amazon DynamoDB to keep track of `for-each` cardinality. This connection requires knowledge of the region that the job executes in and is made available via [instance metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html) on EC2; which unfortunately is not available on ECS (for AWS Fargate). This fix introduces the necessary checks for inferring the region correctly for tasks executing on AWS Fargate. Note that after the recent changes to [Amazon S3's consistency model](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-update-strong-read-after-write-consistency/), the Amazon DynamoDB dependency is no longer needed and will be done away in a subsequent release. PR: [#436](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/436)

## 2.2.6 (Jan 26th, 2021)

The Metaflow 2.2.6 release is a minor patch release.

- Features
  - Support AWS Fargate as compute backend for Metaflow tasks launched on AWS Batch
  - Support `shared_memory`, `max_swap`, `swappiness` attributes for Metaflow tasks launched on AWS Batch
  - Support wider very-wide workflows on top of AWS Step Functions
- Bug Fixes
  - Assign tags to `Run` objects generated through AWS Step Functions executions
  - Pipe all workflow set-up logs to `stderr`
  - Handle null assignment to `IncludeFile` properly

### Features

#### Support AWS Fargate as compute backend for Metaflow tasks launched on AWS Batch

At [AWS re:invent 2020, AWS announced support for AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-fully-serverless-batch-computing-with-aws-batch-support-for-aws-fargate/) as a compute backend (in addition to EC2) for AWS Batch. With this feature, Metaflow users can now submit their Metaflow jobs to AWS Batch Job Queues which are connected to AWS Fargate Compute Environments as well. By setting the environment variable - `METAFLOW_ECS_FARGATE_EXECUTION_ROLE`, users can configure the ecsTaskExecutionRole for the AWS Batch container and AWS Fargate agent.

#### Support `shared_memory`, `max_swap`, `swappiness` attributes for Metaflow tasks launched on AWS Batch

The `@batch` decorator now supports `shared_memory`, `max_swap`, `swappiness` attributes for Metaflow tasks launched on AWS Batch to provide a greater degree of control for memory management.

#### Support wider very-wide workflows on top of AWS Step Functions

The tag `metaflow_version:` and `runtime:` is now available for all packaged executions and remote executions as well. This ensures that every run logged by Metaflow will have `metaflow_version` and `runtime` system tags available.

### Bug Fixes

#### Assign tags to `Run` objects generated through AWS Step Functions executions

`Run` objects generated by flows executed on top of AWS Step Functions were missing the tags assigned to the flow; even though the tags were correctly persisted to tasks. This release fixes and brings inline the tagging behavior as observed with local flow executions.

#### Pipe all workflow set-up logs to `stderr`

Execution set-up logs for `@conda` and `IncludeFile` were being piped to `stdout` which made manipulating the output of commands like `python flow.py step-functions create --only-json` a bit difficult. This release moves the workflow set-up logs to `stderr`.

#### Handle null assignment to `IncludeFile` properly

A workflow executed without a required `IncludeFile` parameter would fail when the parameter was referenced inside the flow. This release fixes the issue by assigning a null value to the parameter in such cases.

## 2.2.5 (Nov 11th, 2020)

The Metaflow 2.2.5 release is a minor patch release.

- Features
  - Log `metaflow_version:` and `runtime:` tag for all executions
- Bug Fixes
  - Handle inconsistently cased file system issue when creating @conda environments on macOS for linux-64

### Features

#### Log `metaflow_version:` and `runtime:` tag for all executions

The tag `metaflow_version:` and `runtime:` is now available for all packaged executions and remote executions as well. This ensures that every run logged by Metaflow will have `metaflow_version` and `runtime` system tags available.

### Bug Fixes

#### Handle inconsistently cased file system issue when creating @conda environments on macOS for linux-64

Conda fails to correctly set up environments for linux-64 packages on macOS at times due to inconsistently cased filesystems. Environment creation is needed to collect the necessary metadata for correctly setting up the conda environment on AWS Batch. This fix simply ignores the error-checks that conda throws while setting up the environments on macOS when the intended destination is AWS Batch.

## 2.2.4 (Oct 28th, 2020)

The Metaflow 2.2.4 release is a minor patch release.

- Features
  - Metaflow is now compliant with AWS GovCloud & AWS CN regions
- Bug Fixes
  - Address a bug with overriding the default value for [IncludeFile](../scaling/data#data-in-local-files)
  - Port AWS region check for AWS DynamoDb from `curl` to `requests`

### Features

#### Metaflow is now compliant with AWS GovCloud & AWS CN regions

AWS GovCloud & AWS CN users can now enjoy all the features of Metaflow within their region partition with no change on their end. PR: #364

### Bug Fixes

#### Address a bug with overriding the default value for [IncludeFile](../scaling/data#data-in-local-files)

Metaflow v2.1.0 introduced a bug in [IncludeFile functionality](../scaling/data#data-in-local-files) which prevented users from overriding the default value specified.

#### Port AWS region check for AWS DynamoDb from `curl` to `requests`

Metaflow's AWS Step Functions' integration relies on AWS DynamoDb to manage [foreach](../metaflow/basics#foreach) constructs. Metaflow was leveraging `curl` at runtime to detect the region for AWS DynamoDb. Some docker images don't have `curl` installed by default; moving to `requests` (a metaflow dependency) fixes the issue.

## 2.2.3 (Sept 8th, 2020)

The Metaflow 2.2.3 release is a minor patch release.

- [Bug Fixes](release-notes.md#bug-fixes)
  - Fix issue [#305](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/issues/305) : Default 'help' for parameters was not handled properly.
  - Pin the conda library versions for Metaflow default dependencies based on the Python version.
  - Add conda bin path to the PATH environment variable during Metaflow step execution.
  - Fix a typo in metaflow/debug.py

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix issue [#305](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/issues/305) : Default 'help' for parameters was not handled properly

Fix the issue where default `help` for parameters was not handled properly. Issue [#305](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/issues/305): flow fails because `IncludeFile`'s default value for the `help` argument is None. PR: [#318](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/318)

#### Pin the conda library versions for Metaflow default dependencies based on the Python version

The previously pinned library version does not work with python 3.8. Now we have two sets of different version combinations which should work for python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8. PR: [#308](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/308)

#### Add conda bin path to the PATH environment variable during Metaflow step execution

Previously the executable installed in conda environment was not visible inside Metaflow steps. Fixing this issue by appending conda bin path to the PATH environment variable. PR: [#307](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/307)

PRs: [#307](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/307), [#308](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/308), [#310](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/310), [#314](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/314), [#317](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/317), [#318](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/318)

## 2.2.2 (Aug 20th, 2020)

The Metaflow 2.2.2 release is a minor patch release.

- [Bug Fixes](release-notes.md#bug-fixes)
  - Fix a regression introduced in 2.2.1 related to Conda environments
  - Clarify Pandas requirements for Tutorial Episode 04
  - Fix an issue with the metadata service

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix a regression with Conda

Metaflow 2.2.1 included a commit which was merged too early and broke the use of Conda. This release reverses this patch.

#### Clarify Pandas version needed for Episode 04

Recent versions of Pandas are not backward compatible with the one used in the tutorial; a small comment was added to warn of this fact.

#### Fix an issue with the metadata service

In some cases, the metadata service would not properly create runs or tasks.

PRs [#296](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/296), [#297](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/297), [#298](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/298)

  - Fix an issue where Conda execution would fail if the Conda environment was not writeable
  - Fix the behavior of uploading artifacts to the S3 datastore in case of retries

### Features

#### Add `include` parameter for `merge_artifacts`

You can now specify the artifacts to be merged explicitly by the `merge_artifacts` method as opposed to just specifying the ones that should _not_ be merged.

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix a regression with datatools

Fixes the regression described in [#285](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/issues/285).

#### Fix an issue with Conda in certain environments

In some cases, Conda is installed system wide and the user cannot write to its installation directory. This was causing issues when trying to use the Conda environment. Fixes [#179](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/issues/179).

#### Fix an issue with the S3 datastore in case of retries

Retries were not properly handled when uploading artifacts to the S3 datastore. This fix addresses this issue.

## 2.2.0 (Aug 4th, 2020)

The Metaflow 2.2.0 release is a minor release and introduces [Metaflow's support for R lang](../../v/r/).

- [Features](release-notes.md#features-1)
  - Support for R lang.

### Features

#### Support for R lang.

This release provides an [idiomatic API to access Metaflow in R lang](../../v/r/). It piggybacks on the Pythonic implementation as the backend providing most of the functionality previously accessible to the Python community. With this release, R users can structure their code as a metaflow flow. Metaflow will [snapshot the code, data, and dependencies](../../v/r/metaflow/basics#the-structure-of-metaflow-code) automatically in a content-addressed datastore allowing for [resuming of workflows](../../v/r/metaflow/debugging#how-to-debug-failed-flows), [reproducing past results, and inspecting anything about the workflow](../../v/r/metaflow/client) e.g. in a notebook or RStudio IDE. Additionally, without any changes to their workflows, users can now [execute code on AWS Batch and interact with Amazon S3 seamlessly](../../v/r/metaflow/scaling).

## 2.1.1 (Jul 30th, 2020)

The Metaflow 2.1.1 release is a minor patch release.

- [Bug Fixes](release-notes.md#bug-fixes)
  - Handle race condition for `/step` endpoint of metadata service.

### Bug Fixes

#### Handle race condition for `/step` endpoint of metadata service.

The `foreach` step in AWS Step Functions launches multiple AWS Batch tasks, each of which tries to register the step metadata if it already doesn't exist. This can result in a race condition and cause the task to fail. This patch properly handles the 409 response from the service.

PR [#258](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/258) & PR [#260](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/260)

## 2.1.0 (Jul 29th, 2020)

The Metaflow 2.1.0 release is a minor release and introduces [Metaflow's integration with AWS Step Functions](../production/scheduling-metaflow-flows/introduction).

- [Features](release-notes.md#features)
  - Add capability to schedule Metaflow flows with AWS Step Functions.
- [Improvements](release-notes.md#improvements)
  - Fix log indenting in Metaflow.
  - Throw exception properly if fetching code package from Amazon S3 on AWS Batch fails.
  - Remove millisecond information from timestamps returned by Metaflow client.
  - Handle CloudWatchLogs resource creation delay gracefully.

### Features

#### Add capability to schedule Metaflow flows with AWS Step Functions.

Netflix uses an [internal DAG scheduler](https://medium.com/@NetflixTechBlog/unbundling-data-science-workflows-with-metaflow-and-aws-step-functions-d454780c6280) to orchestrate most machine learning and ETL pipelines in production. Metaflow users at Netflix can seamlessly deploy and schedule their flows to this scheduler. Now, with this release, we are introducing a similar integration with [AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/) where Metaflow users can [easily deploy & schedule their flows](../production/scheduling-metaflow-flows/introduction) by simply executing

```
python myflow.py step-functions create
```

which will create an AWS Step Functions state machine for them. With this feature, Metaflow users can now enjoy all the features of Metaflow along with a highly available, scalable, maintenance-free production scheduler without any changes in their existing code.

We are also introducing a new decorator - [`@schedule`](../production/scheduling-metaflow-flows/introduction#scheduling-a-flow), which allows Metaflow users to instrument time-based triggers via [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) for their flows deployed on AWS Step Functions.

With this integration, Metaflow users can [inspect](../metaflow/client) their flows deployed on AWS Step Functions as before and [debug and reproduce](../metaflow/debugging#reproducing-production-issues-locally) results from AWS Step Functions on their local laptop or within a notebook.

PR [#211](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/211) addresses Issue [#2](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/issues/2).

### Improvements

#### Fix log indenting in Metaflow.

Metaflow was inadvertently removing leading whitespace from user-visible logs on the console. Now Metaflow presents user-visible logs with the correct formatting.

PR [#244](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/244) fixed issue [#223](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/issues/223).

#### Throw exception properly if fetching code package from Amazon S3 on AWS Batch fails.

Due to malformed permissions, AWS Batch might not be able to fetch the code package from Amazon S3 for user code execution. In such scenarios, it wasn't apparent to the user, where the code package was being pulled from, making triaging any permission issue a bit difficult. Now, the Amazon S3 file location is part of the exception stack trace.

PR [#243](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/243) fixed issue [#232](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/issues/232).

#### Remove millisecond information from timestamps returned by Metaflow client.

Metaflow uses `time` to store the `created_at` and `finished_at` information for the `Run` object returned by Metaflow client. `time` unfortunately does not support the [`%f` directive](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.strftime), making it difficult to parse these fields by `datetime` or `time`. Since Metaflow doesn't expose timings at millisecond grain, this PR drops the `%f` directive.

PR [#227](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/227) fixed issue [#224](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/issues/224).

#### Handle CloudWatchLogs resource creation delay gracefully.

When launching jobs on AWS Batch, the CloudWatchLogStream might not be immediately created (and may never be created if say we fail to pull the docker image for any reason whatsoever). Metaflow will now simply retry again next time.

PR [#209](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/209).

## 2.0.5 (Apr 30th, 2020)

The Metaflow 2.0.5 release is a minor patch release.

- \***\*[**Improvements**](release-notes.md#2-0-5-improvements)\*\***
  - Fix logging of prefixes in `datatools.S3._read_many_files`.
  - Increase retry count for AWS Batch logs streaming.
  - Upper-bound `pylint` version to `< 2.5.0` for compatibility issues.

The Metaflow 2.0.5 release is a minor patch release.

### Improvements <a href="#2-0-5-improvements" id="2-0-5-improvements"></a>

#### Fix logging of prefixes in datatools.S3.\_read_many_files

Avoid a cryptic error message when `datatools.S3._read_many_files` is unsuccessful by converting `prefixes` from a generator to a list.

#### Increase retry count for AWS Batch logs streaming.

Modify the retry behavior for log fetching on AWS Batch by adding jitters to exponential backoffs as well as reset the retry counter for every successful request.

Additionally, fail the Metaflow task when we fail to stream the task logs back to the user's terminal even if AWS Batch task succeeds.

#### Upper-bound pylint version to < 2.5.0.

`pylint` version `2.5.0` would mark Metaflow's `self.next()` syntax as an error. As a result, `python helloworld.py run` would fail at the pylint check step unless we run with `--no-pylint`. This version upper-bound is supposed to automatically downgrade `pylint` during `metaflow` installation if `pylint==2.5.0` has been installed.

## 2.0.4 (Apr 28th, 2020)

The Metaflow 2.0.4 release is a minor patch release.

- \***\*[**Improvements**](release-notes#2-0-4-improvements)\*\***
  - Expose `retry_count` in [`Current`](../scaling/tagging#accessing-current-ids-in-a-flow)
  - Mute superfluous `ThrottleExceptions` in AWS Batch job logs
- \***\*[**Bug Fixes\*\*](release-notes#2-0-4-bug-fixes)
  - Set proper thresholds for retrying `DescribeJobs` API for AWS Batch
  - Explicitly override `PYTHONNOUSERSITE` for `conda` environments
  - Preempt AWS Batch job log collection when the job fails to get into a `RUNNING` state

### Improvements <a href="#2-0-4-improvements" id="2-0-4-improvements"></a>

#### Expose `retry_count` in `Current`

You can now use the [`current`](../scaling/tagging#accessing-current-ids-in-a-flow) singleton to access the `retry_count` of your task. The first attempt of the task will have `retry_count` as 0 and subsequent retries will increment the `retry_count`. As an example:

```python
@retry
@step
def my_step(self):
    from metaflow import current
    print("retry_count: %s" % current.retry_count)
    self.next(self.a)
```

#### Mute superfluous `ThrottleExceptions` in AWS Batch job logs

The AWS Logs API for `get_log_events` has a global hard limit on 10 requests per sec. While we have retry logic in place to respect this limit, some of the `ThrottleExceptions` usually end up in the job logs causing confusion to the end-user. This release addresses this issue (also documented in #184).

### Bug Fixes <a href="#2-0-4-bug-fixes" id="2-0-4-bug-fixes"></a>

#### Set proper thresholds for retrying `DescribeJobs` API for AWS Batch

The AWS Batch API for `describe_jobs` throws `ThrottleExceptions` when managing a flow with a very wide `for-each` step. This release adds retry behavior with backoffs to add proper resiliency (addresses #138).

#### Explicitly override `PYTHONNOUSERSITE` for `conda` environments

In certain user environments, to properly isolate `conda` environments, we have to explicitly override `PYTHONNOUSERSITE` rather than simply relying on `python -s` (addresses #178).

#### Preempt AWS Batch job log collection when the job fails to get into a `RUNNING` state

Fixes a bug where if the AWS Batch job crashes before entering the `RUNNING` state (often due to incorrect IAM perms), the previous log collection behavior would fail to print the correct error message making it harder to debug the issue (addresses #185).

## 2.0.3 (Mar 6th, 2020)

The Metaflow 2.0.3 release is a minor patch release.

- \***\*[**Improvements**](release-notes.md#improvements)\*\***
  - Parameter listing
  - Ability to specify S3 endpoint
  - Usability improvements
- \***\*[**Performance**](release-notes.md#performance)\*\***
  - Conda
- [**Bug Fixes**](release-notes.md#bug-fixes)\*\*\*\*
  - Executing on AWS Batch

### Improvements

#### Parameter listing

You can now use the `current` singleton (documented [here](../scaling/tagging#accessing-current-ids-in-a-flow)) to access the names of the parameters passed into your flow. As an example:

```python
for var in current.parameter_names:
    print("Parameter %s has value %s" % (var, getattr(self, var))
```

This addresses [#137](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/issues/137).

#### Usability improvements

A few issues were addressed to improve the usability of Metaflow. In particular, `show` now properly respects indentation making the description of steps and flows more readable. This addresses [#92](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/issues/92). Superfluous print messages were also suppressed when executing on AWS batch with the local metadata provider ([#152](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/152)).

### Performance

#### Conda

A smaller, newer and standalone Conda installer is now used resulting in faster and more reliable Conda bootstrapping ([#123](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/123)).

### Bug Fixes

#### Executing on AWS Batch

We now check for the command line `--datastore-root` prior to using the environment variable `METAFLOW_DATASTORE_SYSROOT_S3` when determining the S3 root ([#134](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/134)). This release also fixes an issue where using the local Metadata provider with AWS batch resulted in incorrect directory structure in the `.metaflow` directory ([#141](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/pull/141)).
