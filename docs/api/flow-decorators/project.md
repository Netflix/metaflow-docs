# @project

The `@project` decorator makes it convenient to create isolated [Metaflow namespaces](/scaling/tagging) and
corresponding [proudction deployments](/production/scheduling-metaflow-flows/introduction). When
multiple flows use the same project name, they can fetch data across them safely using [the Client API](/metaflow/client), without interference from other users running the same flows.

By itself, `@project` doesn't change the behavior besides [exposing new attributes in the `current` object](/api/current#project). It alters the flow names when they are deployed in production, allowing multiple parallel deployments.

For more information, see [Coordinating Larger Metaflow Projects](/production/coordinating-larger-metaflow-projects).
