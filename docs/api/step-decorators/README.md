# Step Decorators

These decorators are set at the step level, i.e. above the `@step`
decorator.

Notably, you can attach any of these decorators to the flow on the
command line as well without changing the code using the `--with` option. For instance,
```
python myflow.py run --with retry --with batch:cpu=4
```
attaches a `@retry` and `@batch(cpu=4)` decorators to all steps of the flow.
