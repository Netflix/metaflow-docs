# @catch

The `@catch` decorator ensures that a step will succeed, despite any errors in the user code or transient platform issues.

It is best used in conjunction with the `@retry` decorator: After all retries have been exhausted, `@catch` executes a no-op task that allows the run to continue. For more information, see [Dealing with Failures](/metaflow/failures).
