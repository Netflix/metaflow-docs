# Deploying Variants of Event-Triggered Flows

Consider this advanced scenario: You have deployed two flows [linked together
via `@trigger_on_finish`](/production/event-triggering/flow-events#passing-data-across-flows).
The flows run happily in production. At some point, you want to experiment with a new
modeling approach. In order to know if the new approach works better than the
current production version, you'd like to run them concurrently using the same
data, maybe powering an A/B test.

It is critical that the experimental variant doesn't interfere with the
production version. Conceptually, you would like to have two isolated
deployments like here:

```mdx-code-block
import ReactPlayer from 'react-player';
```

<ReactPlayer playing controls muted loop url='/assets/et-variants.mp4' width='100%' height='100%'/>

Fortunately, you can achieve such isolated deployments by using [the `@project`
decorator](/production/coordinating-larger-metaflow-projects) in conjunction
with `@trigger_on_finish`.

## Using `@project` and `@trigger_on_finish` together

```python
from metaflow import FlowSpec, step, current, project

@project(name='variant_demo')
class FirstProjectFlow(FlowSpec):

    @step
    def start(self):
        print("This deployment is called", current.project_flow_name)
        self.next(self.end)

    @step
    def end(self):
        pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    FirstProjectFlow()
```

and 

```python
from metaflow import FlowSpec, step, trigger_on_finish, current, project

@trigger_on_finish(flow='FirstProjectFlow')
@project(name='variant_demo')
class SecondProjectFlow(FlowSpec):

    @step
    def start(self):
        print("This deployment is called", current.project_flow_name)
        print("This run was triggered by", current.trigger.event)
        self.next(self.end)

    @step
    def end(self):
        pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    SecondProjectFlow()
```

Deploy both the flows on Argo Workflows:
```
python firstproject.py argo-workflows create
python secondproject.py argo-workflows create
```

and trigger the first one manually:

```
python firstproject.py argo-workflows trigger
```

Thanks to `@project`, the flows are deployed with a special name that includes a
branch prefix. By default,
[each user gets their own
prefix](/production/coordinating-larger-metaflow-projects#single-flow-multiple-developers),
so the output of the `start` step of `FirstProjectFlow` should look
like:

```
The deployment is called variant_demo.user.alice.FirstProjectFlow
```

The `SecondProjectFlow` starts automatically when `FirstProjectFlow` completes.
It should show output like here:


```
This deployment is called variant_demo.user.alice.SecondProjectFlow
This run was triggered by
MetaflowEvent(name='metaflow.variant_demo.user.alice.FirstProjectFlow.end', ...)
```
which indicates that the event triggering the run is specific to Alice.

### Deploying a parallel branch

To deploy a parallel variant or *a branch* - in the sense of Git branches -
execute the following commands:

```
python firstproject.py --branch new_model argo-workflows create
python secondproject.py --branch new_model argo-workflows create
```
and trigger the branch like here:
```
python firstproject.py --branch new_model argo-workflows trigger
```

You should see a corresponding output for these runs. Importantly, triggering
the `new_model` branch doesn't have any effect on Alice's deployment, which is
[fully isolated in its own namespace](/scaling/tagging).

## Triggering across branches

As shown above, `@project` guarantees that all flows linked together within the
same project and branch are isolated from other deployments. However, sometimes
you may want to depend on an upstream flow that is deployed outside of your
branch. For instance, you may want to deploy a variant of a downstream
workflow, like `SecondProjectFlow` above, while reusing results from an
existing upstream flow, like `FirstProjectFlow`.

You can accomplish this by specifying explicitly the project-branch name that
you want to depend on. For instance, this line makes a flow depend on Alice's
deployment regardless of the branch the flow is deployed on:

```python
@trigger_on_finish(flow='variant_demo.user.alice.FirstProjectFlow')
```
