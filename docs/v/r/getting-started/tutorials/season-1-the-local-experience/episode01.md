# Episode 1: Playlist

This flow loads a movie metadata CSV file and builds a playlist for your favorite movie genre. Everything in Metaflow is versioned, so you can run it multiple times and view all the historical playlists with the Metaflow client in an R Markdown Notebook.

## Showcasing:

- Basic [Metaflow Parameters](../../../metaflow/basics#how-to-define-parameters-for-flows).
- Running workflow [branches](../../../metaflow/basics#branch) in parallel and joining results.
- Using the [Metaflow client](../../../metaflow/client) in an R Markdown Notebook.

## Dataset and flow script

The dataset `movies.csv` looks like this

| movie_title                              | title_year | genre    | gross     |
|:-----------------------------------------|:-----------|:---------|:----------|
| Avatar                                   | 2009       | Sci-Fi   | 760505847 |
| Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End | 2007       | Fantasy  | 309404152 |
| Spectre                                  | 2015       | Thriller | 200074175 |

The flow script below performs the following steps:

1. Ingests a CSV file containing metadata about movies.
2. In parallel branches:
   - Filters movies by the genre parameter.
   - Choose a random movie from a different genre.
3. Displays the top entries from the playlist.

```r
library(metaflow)

# Parse the CSV file
start <- function(self){
    self$df <- read.csv("./movies.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
}

# Filter the movies by genre.
pick_movie <- function(self){
    # select rows which has the specified genre
    movie_by_genre <- self$df[self$df$genre == self$genre, ]

    # randomize the title names
    shuffled_rows <- sample(nrow(movie_by_genre))
    self$movies <- movie_by_genre[shuffled_rows, ]
}

# This step chooses a random movie from a different genre.
bonus_movie <- function(self){
    # select all movies not matching the specified genre
    bonus_movies <- self$df[self$df$genre != self$genre, ]

    idx <- sample(nrow(bonus_movies), size=1)
    self$bonus <- bonus_movies$movie_title[idx]
}

#  Join our parallel branches and merge results.
join <- function(self, inputs){
    # Reassign relevant variables from our branches.
    self$bonus <- inputs$bonus_movie$bonus
    self$playlist <- inputs$pick_movie$movies
}

# Print out the playlist and bonus movie.
end <- function(self){
    message("Playlist for movies in genre: ", self$genre)
    for (i in 1:nrow(self$playlist)){
        message(sprintf("Pick %d: %s", i, self$playlist$title[i]))

        if (i > self$top_k) break;
    }
}

metaflow("PlayListFlow") %>%
    parameter("genre",
              help = "Filter movies for a particular genre.",
              default = "Sci-Fi") %>%
    parameter("top_k",
              help = "The number of movies to recommend in the playlist.",
              default = 5,
              type = "int") %>%
    step(step = "start",
         r_function = start,
         next_step = c("pick_movie", "bonus_movie")) %>%

    step(step = "end",
         r_function = end) %>%
    run()
