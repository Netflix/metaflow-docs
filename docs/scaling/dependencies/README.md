New in Metaflow 2.15.8: You can [use `uv` to manage dependencies](/scaling/dependencies/uv).
:::

A Metaflow flow is defined in a single Python file. Besides the flow code
itself, a typical flow has many *software dependencies*, that is, other
[modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html),
[packages](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages),
and 3rd party libraries like `pandas` or `pytorch` of which the flow is composed.

While the question of dependency management may seem rather mundane, it is a
critically important part of production-quality projects for a number of
reasons:

1. Flows need **a stable execution environment**. You don't want to get
unexpected results because a package abruptly changed under the hood. Each
project may have its own set of dependencies that need to be isolated from
others.

2. It should be possible to **make flows reproducible**. Anyone should be able
to retrieve a flow, rerun it, and get similar results. To make this possible, a
flow can't depend on libraries that are only available on your laptop.

3. **[Remote execution of tasks](/scaling/remote-tasks/requesting-resources)** requires that
all dependencies can be reinstantated on the fly in a remote environment.
Again, this is not possible if the flow depends on libraries that are only
available on your laptop.

Metaflow includes robust but flexible machinery for managing dependencies. You can
get started without hassle and harden the project gradually to provide it with a stable,
reproducible execution environments.

Behind the scenes, Metaflow does much more than just `pip install`'ing packages
on the fly. If you are curious to learn what and why,
see [Packaging Internals](/scaling/dependencies/internals) and [the `@pypi`
announcement blog post](https://outerbounds.com/blog/pypi-announcement/).

## Unpacking a Metaflow project

Let's consider the layers that make up a Metaflow project:

![Layers of dependencies](/assets/dependencies.png)

1. A flow file, e.g. `flow.py` [defines the flow DAG](/metaflow/basics). The
file may contain arbitrary user-defined code, making it easy to get started
just with a single file.

2. As the project grows, it is convenient to [structure the project as multiple
modules and packages](/scaling/dependencies/project-structure), instead of
including hundreds of lines in a single file. Metaflow packages local Python
dependencies like this automatically.

3. Crucially, Metaflow packages Metaflow itself for remote execution so that you
don't have to install it manually when
[using `@batch` and `@kubernetes`](/scaling/remote-tasks/requesting-resources). Also, this
guarantees that all tasks use the same version of Metaflow consistently.

4. External libraries can be included via [the `@pypi` and `@conda`
decorators](/scaling/dependencies/libraries). [Behind the
scenes](/scaling/dependencies/internals), these decorators take care
of dependency resolution, virtual environment creation, and package
snapshotting automatically.

5. Ultimately, all the code executes on top of an operating system which defines
low-level drivers and security functionality. If needed, much of this can be configured
via [a custom Docker image](/scaling/dependencies/containers).

Note that you can [get started with local development](/metaflow/introduction)
without having to worry about any of this. Metaflow
uses libraries you have installed locally like any other Python project.
Dependency management becomes relevant immediately when you want to start
[scaling out to the cloud](/scaling/introduction) or you want to
[deploy the flow in production](/production/introduction).

## Packaging projects for remote execution

To execute tasks outside your local environment, Metaflow snapshots the layers
1-3(dark blue) automatically and stores them in *a code package*. You can
[inspect the package through the Client API](/api/client#metaflowcode) to see
the exact code that was executed by a run.

If you are curious, you can inspect the files that would be included in a code
package by executing

```bash
python myflow.py package list
```

By the default, the package only includes local Python files, not libraries you
have installed e.g. with `pip install` manually. To include external libraries,
you need to include them either in [a custom Docker
image](/scaling/dependencies/containers), [specify them in a `@pypi` or `@conda`
decorator](/scaling/dependencies/conda-vs-pypi), or [use `uv`](/scaling/dependencies/uv).

This figure illustrates the idea:

### Which approach to use?

Let's say your team has a common module `special_module.py` that is used by
many flows. You could include it in any of the three layers. You could

1. Include it next to `flow.py` as a local dependency which Metaflow packages
automatically.
2. Publish it as a Python package and include it with `@pypi`.
3. Include it in a custom Docker image.

Which approach to choose? There may be internal reasons to choose one approach
over the others but if you are unusure, here's an easy rule of thumb: Prefer
local files for any dependencies that need to change quickly.

If you need to change `special_module.py` multiple times a day, the overhead of
having to build new packages or Docker files for every change can be
overwhelming. In contrast, if the file rarely changes, all the approaches work
equally well.
