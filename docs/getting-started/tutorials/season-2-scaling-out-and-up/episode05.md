# Episode 5: Hello AWS

## Look Mom, We're in the Cloud.

This flow is a simple linear workflow that verifies your cloud configuration. The `start` and `end` steps will run locally, while the `hello` step will [run remotely](/scaling/remote-tasks/introduction). After [configuring Metaflow](/getting-started/infrastructure) to run in the cloud, data and metadata about your runs will be stored remotely. This means you can use the client to access information about any flow from anywhere.

You can find the tutorial code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/tree/master/metaflow/tutorials/05-helloaws)

**Showcasing:**

- [AWS Batch](/scaling/remote-tasks/aws-batch) and the [`@batch`](/scaling/remote-tasks/introduction) decorator.
- Using the [Client API ](../../../metaflow/client)to access data artifacts generated remotely in a local notebook.
- [`@retry`](../../../scaling/failures#retrying-tasks-with-the-retry-decorator)decorator.
