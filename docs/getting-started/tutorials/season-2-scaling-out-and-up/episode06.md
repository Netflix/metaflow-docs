# Episode 6: Statistics Redux

## Computing in the Cloud.

This example revisits [Episode 02-statistics: Is this Data Science?](../season-1-the-local-experience/episode02). With Metaflow, you don't need to make any code changes to scale up your flow by running on remote compute. In this example, we re-run the `stats.py` workflow adding the `--with batch` command line argument. This instructs Metaflow to run all your steps in the cloud without changing any code. You can control the behavior with additional arguments, like `--max-workers`**.** For this example, `max-workers` is used to limit the number of parallel genre-specific statistics computations. You can then access the data artifacts \(even the local CSV file\) from anywhere because the data is being stored in the cloud-based datastore.

This tutorial uses `pandas` which may not be available in your environment. Use the 'conda' package manager with the `conda-forge` channel added to run this tutorial in any environment

You can find the tutorial code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/tree/master/metaflow/tutorials/06-statistics-redux)

**Showcasing:**

- `--with batch` command line option
- `--max-workers` command line option
- Accessing data locally or remotely

**Before playing this episode:**

1. `python -m pip install pandas`
2. `python -m pip install notebook`
3. `python -m pip install matplotlib`
4. This tutorial requires access to compute and storage resources on in the cloud, which can be configured by
   1. Following the instructions [here](https://outerbounds.com/docs/engineering-welcome/) or
   2. Requesting [a sandbox](https://outerbounds.com/docs/sandbox/).
5. This tutorial requires the `conda` package manager to be installed with the conda-forge channel added.
   1. Download Miniconda at [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
   2. `conda config --add channels conda-forge`

**To play this episode:**

1. `cd metaflow-tutorials`
2. `python 02-statistics/stats.py --environment conda run --with batch --max-workers 4 --with conda:python=3.7,libraries="{pandas:0.24.2}"`
3. `jupyter-notebook 06-statistics-redux/stats.ipynb`
4. Open _**stats.ipynb**_ in your remote Sagemaker notebook

:::caution

Note for _**Python 2.7**_ users: when opening the _**stats.ipynb**_ in a Sagemaker notebook you will need to change the python kernel by clicking _**Kernel -&gt; Change Kernel -&gt; conda_python2**_ from the pull down menu. This ensures the Pandas dataframe will deserialize correctly.
