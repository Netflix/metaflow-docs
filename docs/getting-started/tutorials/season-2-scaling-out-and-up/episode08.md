# Episode 8: Autopilot

## Scheduling Compute in the Cloud.

This example revisits [Episode 06-statistics-redux: Computing in the Cloud](episode06.md). Wi th Metaflow, you don't need to make any code changes to schedule your flow in the cloud. In this example, we will schedule the `stats.py` workflow using the `argo-workflows create` command-line argument. This instructs Metaflow to schedule your flow on [Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/) without changing any code. You can execute your flow on Argo Workflows by using the `argo-workflows trigger` command-line argument. You can use a notebook to set up a simple dashboard to monitor all of your Metaflow flows.

You can find the tutorial code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/tree/master/metaflow/tutorials/08-autopilot)

**Showcasing:**

- `argo-workflows createe` command-line option
- `argo-workflows trigger` command-line option
- Accessing data locally or remotely through the Metaflow [Client API](../../../metaflow/client.md)
