# Why Metaflow

### 1. Modern businesses are eager to utilize data science and ML

In the past, data scientists and ML engineers had to rely
on a medley of point solutions and custom systems to build ML and data science
applications.

### 2. What is common in DS/ML applications?

Applications can be built quicker and more robustly if they stand on a common, human-friendly foundation. But what should the foundation cover?

### 3. All DS/ML applications use data

**Data** may come in different shapes and sizes and may be loaded from various data stores. However, no matter what data is used, accessing and processing it shouldn't be too cumbersome.

### 4. DS/ML applications need to perform computation

Some applications require a tremendous amount of compute power - think computer vision - while some do with less.
Regardless of the scale, all applications need to perform **computation** reliably. Thanks to cloud computing, 
data scientists and ML engineers should be able to utilize elastic compute resources without friction.

### 5. DS/ML applications consists of multiple interconnected parts

Consider an application that loads data, transforms it, trains a bunch of models, chooses the best performing one, runs
inference, and writes the results to a database. Multi-steps workflows like this are a norm in ML. **A workflow
orchestrator** is needed to make sure all steps get executed in order, on time.

---

### 6. DS/ML applications evolve over time incrementally

Rarely a real-world application is built and deployed only once. Instead, a typical application is built gradually,
through contributions by many people. The project needs to be tracked, organized, and **versioned**, which enables systematic and
continuous improvement over time.

### 7. DS/ML applications produce business value in various ways

To produce real business value, DS/ML applications can't live in a walled garden. They must be integrated with the surrounding systems seamlessly: Some applications enhance data in a database, some power internal dashboards or microservices, whereas some power user-facing products. There are many such ways to **deploy** ML in production. The more valuable the application, the more carefully it needs to be operated and monitored as well.

---

### 8. DS/ML applications should leverage the best tools available

For many data scientists and ML engineers, the most rewarding part of the project is **modeling**. Using their domain
knowledge and expertise, the modeler should be able to choose the best tool for the job amongst off-the-shelf libraries, such as PyTorch, XGBoost, Scikit Learn, and many others. Or, if necessary, they should be able to use a wholly custom approach.

### 9. Metaflow covers the full stack of DS/ML infrastructure

Metaflow was originally created at Netflix, motivated by the realization that data scientists and ML engineers need
help with all these concerns: Any gaps or friction in the stack can slow down the project drastically. Thanks to a 
common foundation
provided by Metaflow, data scientists can iterate on ideas quickly and 
deploy them confidently by relying on a well-defined architecture and best practices, shared by everyone in the team.

### 10. Metaflow takes care of the plumbing, so you can focus on the fun parts

Metaflow provides a robust and user-friendly foundation for a wide spectrum of data-intensive applications, including most data science and ML use cases. Data scientists and ML engineers who know the basics of Python can build their own applications, models, and policies on top of it, while Metaflow takes care of the low-level infrastructure: data, compute, orchestration, and versioning.

---

### 11. Metaflow relies on systems that engineers know and trust

Metaflow was designed at Netflix to serve the needs of business-critical ML/DS applications. It relies on proven and scalable infrastructure which works for small and large organizations alike. Metaflow integrates with all the
top clouds as well as with Kubernetes and systems around them in a responsible manner. It respects the security and other
policies of your company, making engineering teams happy too.
